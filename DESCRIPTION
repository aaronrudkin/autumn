Package: autumn
Version: 0.1
Title: Fast, Modern, and Tidy-Friendly Iterative Raking
Description: autumn performs iterative raking to calculate weights for survey 
  data. It is a modern replacement for anesrake. Like anesrake, it implements 
  the methods described in DeBell and Krosnick (2009). Unlike anesrake, it is 
  ready for a tidy workflow. It also requires no external dependencies, runs
  faster, works with a wider variety of input formats, and has better error 
  handling and messaging.
